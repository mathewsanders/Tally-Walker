# Walker options

## Creating the walker

Along with the probability model to use for random walks, you can also specify how many items to use to determine the next step.  

```Swift

// Markov chain represents a walk where only the last step is considered
var markovWalker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .markovChain)

// Match model is the default option which will automatically use the largest
// number of steps based on the size of n-gram that the model uses
var walker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .matchModel)

// Alternatively, you can request a specific number of steps
var twoStepWalker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .steps(2))

```

## Generating sequences

Sequences are generated with a random walk looking at the last _n_ steps as specified by the walk options.

`Walker` is a type of `Sequence` meaning that you can iterate over it like you would any collection:

```Swift

var walker = Walker(model: model)

// get the next item by a random walk
let item = walker.next()
// returns an optional:
// - for models of continuous sequences this should always return an item
// - for models of discrete sequences `nil` represents the end of a sequence

// End the current random walk so that the next call to `next()` returns the first item in a new walk.
walker.endWalk()

// iterate over items
for item in walker {
    // ... do something with an individual item
}

// generate an array of up to 10 items
let tenItems = walker.fill(request: 10)
// - for models of continuous sequences the array may be less than the requested length
// - for models of discrete sequences the array will be the requested length

```
