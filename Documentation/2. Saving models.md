# Saving models

By default, models are in-memory only, and will not persist.

Setting the `store` property of a Tally model with a `TallyStoreType` that works with the same type you can configure the model to use a different store, including stores that persist the model.

The easiest way to create a TallyStoreType is to create a store that's based on a tree structure, and to implement the `TallyStoreTreeNode` protocol for the nodes of the tree. See the implementation of [MemoryTallyStore](Tally/Tally/MemoryTallyStore.swift) for an example of this approach.

## CoreDataTallyStore

Tally & Walker ships with `CoreDataTallyStore` which can be used to persist the Tally model through an sqlite store.

```Swift

// Create the Tally store.
// With this convenience initializer a sqlite store called
// 'WordStore.sqlite' will be created in the application
// default directory.
let wordStore = CoreDataTallyStore<String>(named: "WordStore")

// Create a Tally model for Strings, and link model to the store
var model = Tally<String>()
model.store = AnyTallyStore(wordStore)

// Observations on a Core Data backed store are performed on a background
// thread, an optional closure an be used to trigger behavior once the
// observation has completed
model.observe(sequence: ["hello", "world"]) {
  print("Observation finished!")
}

// Manually call `save()` at an appropriate time to propagate changes
// to the Core Data store.
wordStore.save()

```

Before using `CoreDataTallyStore`, you'll also need to extend the type so that it implements the `LosslessConvertible` protocol, which in turn describes how your type should be represented in a Core Data store.

```Swift

extension String: LosslessConvertible {

    // return the value that will be used by the Core Data store
    public var losslessRepresentation: CoreDataTallyStoreLosslessRepresentation {
        return .string(self)
    }

    // initialize the type from the value in the Core Data store
    public init?(_ representation: CoreDataTallyStoreLosslessRepresentation) {
        if case let .string(stringValue) = representation {
            self = stringValue
        }
        else { return nil }
    }
}

```

`LosslessConvertible` includes options for types to be converted to one of the following types: `String`, `Bool`, `Double`, `Int16`, and `NSDictionary`.

Converting your type to a `NSDictionary` means that even complex types can be safely represented in the Core Data store, however use of one of the scalar type if preferred because this allows optimizations that both increases speed, and decreases the size of the generated store.
