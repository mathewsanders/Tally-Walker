# Using Tally

## Creating models

By default, `Tally` creates a model to represent continuous sequences, using a bi-gram (which is an n-gram with two items).

Both of these default options can be changed when creating a new model:

```Swift

// create a model to represent a discrete sequence using a 3-gram
var model = Tally<String>(representing: .discreteSequence, ngram: .trigram)

// create a model to represent a continuous sequence using a 4-gram
var model = Tally<String>(representing: .continuousSequence, ngram: ngram(4))

```

Choose `.continuousSequence` when your sequences have no arbitrary beginning or end, or when the beginning and end of an observed sequence doesn't mean anything.

Choose `.discreteSequence` when you want the items that start and end a sequence to have significance.

Take caution with using larger n-grams! Larger n-grams will impact memory and performance. If you can't get your expected outcome using a bigram or trigram it's possible that another approach might be better suited for your purposes.

## Training models  

If all items in a sequence can't be observed in a single pass, items can be observed individually if you wrap the observations in calls to `startSequence()` and `endSequence()`

```Swift

// load text to model
let tweets: [String] = ["...tweet text here..."]

for tweet in tweets {

  // start a sequence
  model.startSequence()

  // enumerate items and observe them one at a time
  tweet.enumerateSubstrings(in: tweet.startIndex..<tweet.endIndex, options: .byWords, { word, _, _, _ in
    if let word = word {
      model.observe(next: word)
    }
  })

  // end the sequence
  model.endSequence()
}

```

## Getting probabilities

Along with returning the probability of items that follow a single item, it's also possible to look for items that follow a sequence of items, however the length of the sequence that can be searched is limited by the size of the n-gram that the model uses.

```Swift

// Create a model that uses 3-gram
var genes = Tally<Character>(ngram: .trigram)

/* train the model */

// find probabilities of items that follow the item 'C'
genes.elementProbabilities(after: "C")

// Find probabilities of items that follow the sequence 'C-T'  
genes.elementProbabilities(following: ["C", "T"])

// Because this model uses a 3-gram, it's not possible to find probabilities of
// items that follow a sequence longer than two items, instead of returning no
// matches, the model will clamp the sequence to the maximum size that the
// model allows, in this case returning items that follow the sequence 'G-A'
genes.elementProbabilities(following: ["C", "T", "G", "A"])

```
