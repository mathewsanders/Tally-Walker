# Using Tally with custom objects

Since Tally works with generic types, it's possible to build models around your own classes or structures.

The default in-memory store uses Tally items as a dictionary index, so items must adopt the `Hashable` protocol.
Additionally, if you want to save your models with a `CoreDataTallyStore`, then your items must also adopt the `LosslessConvertible` protocol.

## Adopting Hashable protocol

````Swift

struct Person: Hashable {

  let firstName: String
  let lastName: String

  // Hashable requires a `hashValue` property
  var hashValue: Int {
    return firstName.hashValue ^ lastName.hashValue
  }

  // Hashable requires Equatable, which requires a == function to be defined
  static func == (lhs: Person, rhs: Person) -> Bool {
    return lhs.firstName == rhs.firstName && lhs.lastName == rhs.lastName
  }
}

// now we can create an n-gram out of `Person` objects
var people = Tally<Person>()

````

## Adopting LosslessConvertible protocol

The safest option for making your custom types implement `LosslessConvertible` is to represent your item as an NSDictionary:

```Swift

extension Person: LosslessConvertible {

    // return the value that will be used by the Core Data store
    public var losslessRepresentation: CoreDataTallyStoreLosslessRepresentation {

        let dict = NSDictionary(dictionary: [
            "firstName": firstName,
            "lastName": lastName
        ])

        return .dictionary(dict)
    }

    // initialize the type from the value in the Core Data store
    public init?(_ representation: CoreDataTallyStoreLosslessRepresentation) {

        guard case let .dictionary(dictValue) = representation,
            let firstName = dictValue["firstName"] as? String,
            let lastName = dictValue["lastName"] as? String
            else { return nil }

        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName

    }
}

```

The downside of this approach is that Core Data will store the dictionary representation of your item as a binary blob. Blobs currently can't be constrained to unique values so the size of the resulting store size may become quite large.

Perhaps more importantly, performance will be impacted, since conversion from the binary blob to the Dictionary is an expensive operation.

An alternative approach to consider is finding a way to represent your items as a non-dictionary type. If you have a finite number of types, you could consider representing each type as a numeric code and storing as an `Int`, or like our person example, you could find a way to represent the item as a `String`:

```Swift

extension Person: LosslessConvertible {

    // return the value that will be used by the Core Data store
    public var losslessRepresentation: CoreDataTallyStoreLosslessRepresentation {

        let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
        return .string(fullName)
    }

    // initialize the type from the value in the Core Data store
    public init?(_ representation: CoreDataTallyStoreLosslessRepresentation) {

        guard case let .string(fullName) = representation
            else { return nil }

        let components = fullName.components(separatedBy: " ")

        guard let firstName = components.first,
            let lastName = components.last
            else { return nil }

        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName

    }
}

```

Because the `Person` object is represented by Core Data as a `String`, optimizations to the store size and performance are made. Use caution with this approach, since you're responsible for ensuring that your item can to safely converted to the scalar type you choose.
