# Using Tally with complex objects

Tally is a generic class that is ready to work on any type that is `Hashable`.
If you want to use Tally with your custom objects, just make sure that complies to the `Hashable` protocol:

````Swift

struct Cat: Hashable {

  let name: String

  // Hashable requires a `hashValue` property
  var hashValue: Int {
    return name.hashValue
  }

  // Hashable requires Equatable, which requires a == function to be defined
  static func == (lhs: Cat, rhs: Cat) -> Bool {
    return lhs.name == rhs.name
  }
}

// now we can create an n-gram out of `Cat` objects
var catsgram = Tally<Cat>()

````
