# Tally & Walker

Tally & Walker is a lightweight Swift library for building probability models of n-grams.

## Quick example

Build a frequency model of n-grams by observing example sequences:

````Swift

// Create a model out of any type that adopts the `Hashable` protocol
var weatherModel = Tally<Character>()

// Observe sequences of items to build the probability model
weatherModel.observe(sequence: ["üåß","üåß","üåß","üåß", "‚òÄÔ∏è","‚òÄÔ∏è","‚òÄÔ∏è","‚òÄÔ∏è"])

// Check the overall distributions of items observed
weatherModel.distributions()
// Returns:
// [(probability: 0.5, element: "üåß"),
//  (probability: 0.5, element: "‚òÄÔ∏è")]

// Check to see what items are expected to follow a specific item  
weatherModel.itemProbabilities(after: "‚òÄÔ∏è")
// Returns:
// [(probability: 0.75, element: "‚òÄÔ∏è"),
//  (probability: 0.25, element: "üåß")]

weatherModel.itemProbabilities(after: "üåß")
// Returns:
// [(probability: 0.75, element: "üåß"),
//  (probability: 0.25, element: .unseenItems)]
//
// `.unseenItems` is a marker to say that the sequence continues but, based
// on the sequences we have observed, we don't know what items come next

````

Generate new sequences based off a random walk using through the probability model:

````Swift

// Create a walker from a frequency model
var walker = Walker(model: weatherModel)

// Create four weeks of 7 day forecasts
for _ in 0..<4 {
  let forecast = walker.fill(request: 7)
  print(forecast)
}

// Prints:
// ["‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "üåß", "üåß", "üåß", "üåß", "üåß"]
// ["‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "üåß", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "üåß", "‚òÄÔ∏è"]
// ["üåß", "üåß", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è"]
// ["‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è"]
//
// Although the overall distribution of rainy days and sunny days are equal
// we don't want to generate a sequence based off a coin flip. Instead we
// except that the weather tomorrow is more likely the same as the weather
// today, and that we will find clusters of rainy and sunny days but that
// over time the number of rainy days and sunny days will approach each other.

````

## Using Tally

### Creating Model

By default, `Tally` creates a model to represent continuous sequences, using a bi-gram (which is an n-gram with two items).

Both of these default options can be changed when creating a new model:

```Swift

// create a model to represent a discrete sequence using a 3-gram
var model = Tally<String>(representing: .discreteSequence, ngram: .trigram)

// create a model to represent a continuous sequence using a 4-gram
var model = Tally<String>(representing: .continuousSequence, ngram: ngram(4))

```

Choose `.continuousSequence` when your sequences have no arbitrary beginning or end, or when the beginning and end of an observed sequence doesn't mean anything.

Choose `.discreteSequence` when you want the items that start and end a sequence to have significance.

Take caution with using larger n-grams! Larger n-grams will impact memory and performance. If you can't get your expected outcome using a bigram or trigram it's possible that another approach might be better suited for your purposes.

### Training the model  

If all items in a sequence can't be observed in a single pass, items can be observed individually if you wrap the observations in calls to `startSequence()` and `endSequence()`

```Swift

// load text to model
let tweets: [String] = ["...tweet text here..."]

for tweet in tweets {

  // start a sequence
  model.startSequence()

  // enumerate items and observe them one at a time
  tweet.enumerateSubstrings(in: tweet.startIndex..<tweet.endIndex, options: .byWords, { word, _, _, _ in
    if let word = word {
      model.observe(next: word)
    }
  })

  // end the sequence
  model.endSequence()
}

```

### Getting probabilities

Along with returning the probability of items that follow a single item, it's also possible to look for items that follow a sequence of items, however the length of the sequence that can be searched is limited by the size of the n-gram that the model uses.

```Swift

// Create a model that uses 3-gram
var genes = Tally<Character>(ngram: .trigram)

/* train the model */

// find probabilities of items that follow the item 'C'
genes.elementProbabilities(after: "C")

// Find probabilities of items that follow the sequence 'C-T'  
genes.elementProbabilities(following: ["C", "T"])

// Because this model uses a 3-gram, it's not possible to find probabilities of
// items that follow a sequence longer than two items, instead of returning no
// matches, the model will clamp the sequence to the maximum size that the
// model allows, in this case returning items that follow the sequence 'G-A'
genes.itemProbabilities(after: ["C", "T", "G", "A"])

```

### Using Tally with custom objects

Tally is a generic class that is ready to work on any type that is `Hashable`.
If you want to use Tally with your custom objects, just make sure that complies to the `Hashable` protocol:

````Swift

struct Cat: Hashable {

  let name: String

  // Hashable requires a `hashValue` property
  var hashValue: Int {
    return name.hashValue
  }

  // Hashable requires Equatable, which requires a == function to be defined
  static func == (lhs: Cat, rhs: Cat) -> Bool {
    return lhs.name == rhs.name
  }
}

// now we can create an n-gram out of `Cat` objects
var catsgram = Tally<Cat>()

````

## Using Walker

### Creating the walker

Along with the probability model to use for random walks, you can also specify how many items to use to determine the next step.  

```Swift

// Markov chain represents a walk where only the last step is considered
var markovWalker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .markovChain)

// Match model is the default option which will automatically use the largest
// number of steps based on the size of n-gram that the model uses
var walker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .matchModel)

// Alternatively, you can request a specific number of steps
var twoStepWalker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .steps(2))

```

### Generating sequences

Sequences are generated with a random walk looking at the last _n_ steps as specified by the walk options.

`Walker` is a type of `Sequence` meaning that you can iterate over it like you would any collection:

```Swift

var walker = Walker(model: model)

// get the next item by a random walk
let item = walker.next()
// returns an optional:
// - for models of continuous sequences this should always return an item
// - for models of discrete sequences `nil` represents the end of a sequence

// End the current random walk so that the next call to `next()` returns the first item in a new walk.
walker.endWalk()

// iterate over items
for item in walker {
    // ... do something with an individual item
}

// generate an array of up to 10 items
let tenItems = walker.fill(request: 10)
// - for models of continuous sequences the array may be less than the requested length
// - for models of discrete sequences the array will be the requested length

```

## Saving Models

By default, models are in-memory only, and will not persist.

Setting the `store` property of a Tally model with a `TallyStoreType` that works with the same type you can configure the model to use a different store, including stores that persist the model.

The easiest way to create a TallyStoreType is to create a store that's based on a tree structure, and to implement the `TallyStoreTreeNode` protocol for the nodes of the tree. See the implementation of [MemoryTallyStore](Tally/Tally/MemoryTallyStore.swift) for an example of this approach.

### CoreDataTallyStore

Tally & Walker ships with `CoreDataTallyStore` which can be used to persist the Tally model through an sqlite store.

```Swift

// Create the Tally store.
// With this convenience initializer a sqlite store called
// 'WordStore.sqlite' will be created in the application
// default directory.
let wordStore = CoreDataTallyStore<String>(named: "WordStore")

// Create a Tally model for Strings, and link model to the store
var model = Tally<String>()
model.store = AnyTallyStore(wordStore)

// Observations on a Core Data backed store are performed on a background
// thread, an optional closure an be used to trigger behavior once the
// observation has completed
model.observe(sequence: ["hello", "world"]) {
  print("Observation finished!")
}

// Manually call `save()` at an appropriate time to propagate changes
// to the Core Data store.
wordStore.save()

```

Before using `CoreDataTallyStore`, you'll also need to extend the type so that it implements the `LosslessConvertible` protocol, which in turn describes how your type should be represented in a Core Data store.

```Swift

extension String: LosslessConvertible {

    // return the value that will be used by the Core Data store
    public var losslessRepresentation: CoreDataTallyStoreLosslessRepresentation {
        return .string(self)
    }

    // initialize the type from the value in the Core Data store
    public init?(_ representation: CoreDataTallyStoreLosslessRepresentation) {
        if case let .string(stringValue) = representation {
            self = stringValue
        }
        else { return nil }
    }
}

```

`LosslessConvertible` includes options for types to be converted to one of the following types: `String`, `Bool`, `Double`, `Int16`, and `NSDictionary`.

Converting your type to a `NSDictionary` means that even complex types can be safely represented in the Core Data store, however use of one of the scalar type if preferred because this allows optimizations that both increases speed, and decreases the size of the generated store.
