# Tally & Walker

Tally & Walker is a lightweight Swift library for building probability models of n-grams.

## Quick example 

Build a frequency model of n-grams by observing example sequences:

````Swift

// Create a model out of any type that adopts the `Hashable` protocol
var weatherModel = Tally<Character>()

// Observe sequences of items to build the probability model 
weatherModel.observe(sequence: ["üåß","üåß","üåß","üåß", "‚òÄÔ∏è","‚òÄÔ∏è","‚òÄÔ∏è","‚òÄÔ∏è"])

// Check the overall distributions of items observed
weatherModel.distributions()
// Returns: 
// [(item: "üåß", probability: 0.5), 
//  (item: "‚òÄÔ∏è", probability: 0.5)]

// Check to see what items are expected to follow a specific item  
weatherModel.items(following: "‚òÄÔ∏è")
// Returns:
// [(item: "‚òÄÔ∏è", probability: 0.75), 
//  (item: "üåß", probability: 0.25)]

weatherModel.items(following: "üåß")
// Returns: 
// [(item: "üåß", probability: 0.75), 
//  (item: .observableBoundary, probability: 0.25)]
//
// `.observableBoundary` implies that we expect the sequence continues, but based on the 
// sequences we've observed we've reached a boundary and don't know what item follows

````

Generate new sequences based off a random walk using through the probability model:

````Swift

// Create a walker from a frequency model
var walker = Walker(model: weatherModel)

// Create four weeks of 7 day forecasts
for _ in 0..<4 {
let forecast = walker.fill(max: 7)
print(forecast)
}

// Prints: 
// ["‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "üåß", "üåß", "üåß", "üåß", "üåß"]
// ["‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "üåß", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "üåß", "‚òÄÔ∏è"]
// ["üåß", "üåß", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è"]
// ["‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è", "‚òÄÔ∏è"]
// 
// Although the overal distribution of rainy days and sunny days are equal
// we don't want to generate a sequence based off a coin flip. Instead we
// except that the weather tomorrow is more likely the same as the weather
// today, and that we will find clusters of rainy and sunny days but that
// over time the number of rainy days and sunny days will apprach each other.

````

## Using Tally 

### Creating Model 

By default, `Tally` creates a model to represent continuous sequences, using a bi-gram.

```Swift

// create a model to represent a discrete sequence using a 3-gram
var model = Tally<String>(representing: .discreteSequence, ngram: .trigram)

// create a model to represent a continuous sequence using a 4-gram
var model = Tally<String>(representing: .continuousSequence, ngram: ngram(4))

```

### Training the model  

If all items in a sequence can't be observed in a single pass, items can be observed individually if you wrap the observations in calls to `startSequence()` and `endSequence()`

```Swift

// load text to model
let tweets: [String] = ["... tweet text here..."]

for tweet in tweets {

// start a sequence 
model.startSequence()

// enumerate items and observe them one at a time
tweet.enumerateSubstrings(in: tweet.startIndex..<tweet.endIndex, options: .byWords, { word, _, _, _ in
if let word = word {
model.observe(next: word)
}
})

// end the sequence 
model.endSequence()
}

```

### Getting probabilities

Along with returning the probability of items that follow a single item, it's alow possible to look for items that follow a sequence of items.
However the length of the sequence that can be searched is limited by the size of the n-gram that the model uses.

```Swift

// Create a model that uses 3-gram
var genes = Tally<Character>(ngram: .trigram)

/* train the model */

// find probabilities of items that follow the item 'C'
genes.items(following: "C")

// Find probabilities of items that follow the sequence 'C-T'  
genes.items(following: ["C", "T"])

// Because this model uses a 3-gram, it's not possible to find items
// that follow a sequence longer than two items, instead of returning
// no matches, the model will clamp the sequence to the maximum size
// that the model allows, in this case returning items that follow
// the sequence 'G-A'
genes.items(following: ["C", "T", "G", "A"])

```
### Using Tally with custom objects

Tally is a generic class that is ready to work on any type that is `Hashable`.
If you want to use Tally with your custom objects, just make sure that complies to the `Hashable` protocol:

````Swift

struct Cat: Hashable {

let name: String

// Hashable requires a `hashValue` property
var hashValue: Int {
return name.hashValue
}

// Hashable requires Equatable, which requires a == function to be defined
static func == (lhs: Cat, rhs: Cat) -> Bool {
return lhs.name == rhs.name
}
}

// now we can create an n-gram out of `Cat` objects
var catsgram = Tally<Cat>()

````

## Using Walker 

### Creating the walker 

Along with the probability model to use for random walks, you can also specify how many items to use to determine the next step.  

```Swift

// Markov chain represents a walk where only the last step is considered
var markovWalker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .markovChain)

// Match model is the default option which will automaticaly use the largest 
// number of steps based on the size of n-gram that the model uses
var walker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .matchModel)

// Alternativley, you can request a specific number of steps 
var twoStepWalker = Walker(model: model, walkOptions: .steps(2))

```
